# Transaction System Fixes

## Initial Issues
1. Direct debt asset purchases were being incorrectly routed to admin approval
2. Pool transactions were not properly handling the pool main asset price
3. Commodity transactions needed special handling for admin approval

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Pool Check Query Issue**
   - The LEFT JOIN in the pool check query was causing false positives
   - Assets were being identified as pool assets even when they weren't actively in a pool

2. **Transaction Type Confusion**
   - System wasn't properly distinguishing between:
     - Direct debt asset purchases (should complete automatically)
     - Pool asset purchases (require admin approval + pool main asset price)
     - Commodity purchases (require admin approval + price verification)

3. **Price Parameter Handling**
   - `price_per_token` was not being properly passed through the transaction flow
   - Pool main asset price validation was happening at the wrong stage

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Pool Asset Detection
```sql
-- Changed from LEFT JOIN to a more precise subquery
SELECT 
  a.type,
  (SELECT p.id 
   FROM pools p 
   JOIN pool_assets pa ON pa.pool_id = p.id 
   WHERE pa.asset_id = a.id 
   AND pa.balance > 0  -- Only consider active pool assets
   LIMIT 1) as pool_id
FROM assets a
WHERE a.id = p_asset_id;
```

### 2. Improved Transaction Flow
- **Direct Debt Assets**: Complete immediately with balance updates
- **Pool Assets**: Create pending transaction with pool metadata
- **Commodities**: Create pending transaction with commodity flag

### 3. Enhanced Metadata Handling
```sql
-- Added explicit flags in transaction metadata
jsonb_build_object(
  'fee_usd', p_fee,
  'payment_method', 'usd_balance',
  'pool_id', v_pool_id,
  'usd_amount', p_total_to_pay - p_fee,
  'is_commodity', v_asset_type = 'commodity'
)
```

### 4. Approval Logic Refinement
- Added proper validation for required parameters based on transaction type
- Pool main asset price only required for pool transactions
- Price per token required for both pool and commodity transactions

## Key Improvements
1. **Transaction Creation**:
   - Clear distinction between transaction types
   - Proper metadata flags for transaction routing
   - Immediate completion for direct debt assets

2. **Transaction Approval**:
   - Early validation of required parameters
   - Conditional processing based on transaction type
   - Proper pool balance updates for pool transactions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging throughout the process
   - Clear error messages for missing parameters
   - Better validation of user balances and pool states

## Testing Verification
- Direct debt asset purchases now complete automatically
- Pool asset purchases require admin approval and pool main asset price
- Commodity purchases require admin approval and price verification
- All balance updates are processed correctly
- Pool TVL (Total Value Locked) updates properly for pool transactions
